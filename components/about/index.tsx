        What do <strong>Neuroscience</strong>, <strong>AI</strong>, and <strong>Blockchain</strong>{" "}
        have in common? These are fields that are constantly evolving and might change the world in
        significant ways - some believe for the better, others for the worse. The potential and

        Currently, I am a Full Stack and Blockchain Developer based in Chicago. I have over 3 years
        of experience in
        <em>Crypto</em>, <em>NFTs</em>, <em>DeFi</em>, and <em>Web 3.0</em>. I{"'"}ve led projects
        from concept to production, developed NFT minting dapps, and my latest achievement was to
        increase the gas efficiency of a wildly used ERC20 token contract by 100%. My skills span{" "}
        <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>TypeScript</em>, <em>Node.js</em>, <em>React/Next.js</em>, <em>TailwindCSS</em>, <em>Solidity</em>, <em>Hardhat</em>, <em>Foundry</em>, <em>Ethers.js</em>, and <em>Slither</em>.

        My versatile skill set extends beyond web and blockchain development to data analysis and
        computational research, where I{"'"}ve managed projects, released novel simulation software,
        published impactful journal articles, and received a research progress award at Northwestern
        University. I also have industry experience working on machine learning and deep learning
        projects using <em>Python</em> - <em>PyTorch, Scikit-Learn</em>, and{" "}
        <em>AWS Cloud Services</em>.

        In addition to my professional work, I{"'"}m dedicated to promoting Web3 adoption. I
        co-founded multiple web3 communities and regularly host{" "}
        <a href="https://oatestalkcrypto.eventbrite.com">crypto community events</a> in Chicago. I
        am excited about the potential of blockchain and decentralized technologies and am dedicated
        to bringing Web3 adoption to the masses. If you{"'"}re looking for a versatile developer who
        can take your projects to the next level, let{"'"}s connect and discuss how I can contribute
